    My name is Lawrence and welcome to my site!
  </p>

  <p>
    I live in San Francisco now. And I work at Stripe as a software engineer.
    Before that, I studied Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and
    did a bunch of internships.  Outside of work, I enjoy reading, riding my
    bikes (I own 1 road bike and 3 e-bikes), complaining about the lack of safe
    street infrastructure and good public transportation, cooking plant-based
    meals, going on backpacking trips, roller skating in Golden Gate Park, and
    many other things!
  </p>

  <p>
    I would love to be helpful to you if I can. The best way to reach out to me
    is <a href="mailto:lawrencefeipan@gmail.com">via email</a>. I check my inbox
    daily and will get back to you as soon as I can.
  </p>

    Lastly, here are some of my public blog posts. I do not write publicly
    regularly, though I do enjoy writing and write often (private journals /
    docs at work). Enjoy!
